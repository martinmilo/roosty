#   overview               roosty with no arguments
#   show "book-workshop"   roosty show <id>; `show` alone runs it without an id
#   validate               roosty validate
#   scan                   roosty scan
#   init                   roosty init
#   changes                roosty changes; changes "--since", "3d" passes arguments on
#
# The overview and changes read the date. Their clock is always pinned, so a test never changes
# its answer as real time passes: today is 2026-10-10 unless the test says today: "2026-11-02",
# and a day starts at 00:00 UTC on every machine.

# roosty scan runs the project's own script, .roosty/scan. In a test that script is a fake:
#
#   scan_prints "# covers: http\n"                      a script that prints this and exits 0
#   scan_prints text, stderr: "no database", exit: 3    ...and writes to stderr, and exits 3
#   scan_script "leaves-a-trace.sh"                     test/fixtures/scans/leaves-a-trace.sh
